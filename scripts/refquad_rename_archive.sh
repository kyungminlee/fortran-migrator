# Rename every Fortran-mangled symbol (lowercase + trailing underscore)
# in a static archive from `<name>_` to `<name>_quad_`. Used as a
# POST_BUILD step on refblas_quad and reflapack_quad so they coexist in
# the same link with the standard `blas` / `lapack` archives.
#
# Why rename everything (not just public BLAS / LAPACK entries):
# upstream Fortran routines have many internal helpers (dladiv1_,
# dladiv2_, dlartg_, …) that aren't in any ref_quad_*.f90 interface
# block but are called from the public routines. If those internals
# stayed un-renamed, kind4 / kind8 baseline links would pull
# dladiv.f.o from BOTH archives and ld would error on multiple
# definition. Renaming uniformly is also kind to migrated test cycles
# that already pull std blas / lapack on their PUBLIC chain — the
# native helpers from std blas / lapack satisfy any leftover lsame_ /
# ilaenv_ / dlamch_ references.
#
# objcopy --redefine-syms renames both definitions and references, so
# cross-archive calls stay consistent: reflapack_quad's
# `U dnrm2_` reference is renamed to `U dnrm2_quad_`, then resolved
# from refblas_quad which now exports `T dnrm2_quad_`.
#
# Usage: refquad_rename_archive.sh <archive.a> [<sibling.a> ...] \
#                                   [-x <exclude.a> ...]
#
# Renames every Fortran-mangled symbol *defined* in <archive.a> or any
# sibling archive, EXCEPT names defined in any -x archive. References
# to renamed names inside <archive.a> are renamed in lockstep so
# cross-archive calls (reflapack_quad → refblas_quad's dnrm2_ →
# dnrm2_quad_) stay consistent.
#
# Exclude archives carry "common" routines that the migrated build
# expects to find under their ORIGINAL names — e.g. lapack_common
# provides iparam2stage_ (patched), la_constants_ep, mumps_abort_, …
# and these are referenced by reflapack_quad. Renaming those refs to
# `*_quad_` would leave them dangling in the migrated link cycle (no
# archive defines `iparam2stage_quad_`). The exclude list pulls the
# names out of the rename set so the references stay un-renamed and
# resolve normally.
#
# Snapshot mechanism: each archive's defined Fortran symbols are
# written to ``<archive>.quad-symbols`` *before* the rename. Sibling
# archives may already be renamed by the time this script runs on
# them, in which case `nm` returns `*_quad_` names; we read the
# pre-rename snapshot file instead.
#
# A stamp file alongside the archive marks completion so re-runs are
# no-ops (objcopy is non-idempotent without the guard — running twice
# yields `<name>_quad_quad_`).
