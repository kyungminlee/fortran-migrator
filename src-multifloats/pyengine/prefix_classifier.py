"""Precision prefix classification via empirical pattern discovery.

Discovers precision structure by analyzing the full symbol set in two passes:

  Pass 1 (single precision): Replace S→#R, C→#C at candidate positions.
  Pass 2 (double precision): Replace D→#R, Z→#C at candidate positions.

Each replaced position carries a **type tag** (R=real, C=complex) so
that multi-position patterns like DZNRM2→#C#RNRM2 know position 0 is
complex and position 1 is real — and never collide with an unrelated
pattern where the two slots carry different types.

A family is formed by overlapping pass-1 and pass-2 results that share
the same tagged pattern AND the same slot positions. Pass-1 members
(S/C) come from single-precision source; pass-2 members (D/Z) come
from double-precision source. **Only the D/Z members drive renames**
— they are the extension sources (D→Q/E, Z→X/Y). S/C symbols keep
their original names and are copied through.

Because type tags are part of the grouping key, real and complex
families are always distinct:
  - (SGEMM, DGEMM) forms a real family with pattern "#R GEMM".
  - (CGEMM, ZGEMM) forms a complex family with pattern "#C GEMM".
  - (CSROT, ZDROT) forms a cross-type family with pattern
    "#C#R ROT" (pos 0 complex, pos 1 real).

This naturally handles any prefix convention without hardcoding:
  - Direct:      SGEMM/DGEMM, CGEMM/ZGEMM
  - I-prefix:    ISAMAX/IDAMAX, ICAMAX/IZAMAX
  - ScaLAPACK:   PSGESV/PDGESV, PCGESV/PZGESV
  - Cross-type:  CSROT/ZDROT
