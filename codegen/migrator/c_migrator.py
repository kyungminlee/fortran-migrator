"""General-purpose C type migration engine.

Handles C source files that use the template-clone pattern (like BLACS):
type-specific files are near-identical clones differing only in C type
names and MPI datatype constants.

Migration is done by cloning files with mechanical text substitution.
No clang parser needed — C types are unambiguous single tokens.

This module owns the generic rename-map-driven engine; the shared clone
primitives and per-library passes (BLACS directory handling / Bdef.h
patching, PBLAS header and idiom knowledge) live in the ``c``
subpackage, mirroring the ``fortran/`` per-concern layout.
