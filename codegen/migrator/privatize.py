"""Post-migration symbol privatization (``ep_`` prefix).

The family-independent support archives of the extended-precision stack
(``blacs_common``, ``pblas_common``, ``scalapack_common``,
``ptzblas_common``) are built from Netlib sources and export the same symbol names as MKL's proprietary
BLACS/PBLAS/ScaLAPACK internals — while disagreeing on internal struct
layout (``BLACBUFF`` is 48 bytes in the Netlib engine, 56 in MKL's).
A consumer linking both gets exactly one definition per name
process-wide, so the two engines collapse into a mixed stack that
corrupts shared state at np>=2 and SIGSEGVs in **either** link order
once the ScaLAPACK type-3 root actually executes.

Fix: the extended stack gets its own hermetic engine. Every name in the
checked-in manifest (``codegen/recipes/privatize_ep_symbols.txt``) is renamed
``name -> ep_name`` — definitions, call sites, internal headers and
override files uniformly — in the migrated staged sources of every
recipe that opts in via the ``privatize_symbols:`` key. This is the
source-level equivalent of the ``objcopy --redefine-syms`` rewrite the
task 44 Phase 0 prototype validated end-to-end.

The pass runs at the very end of :func:`pipeline.run_migration`,
strictly after clones, header patches, the extern-"C" wrap and override
copies, so nothing regenerates a pristine name behind it. Baseline
(kind4/kind8) stagings and the verbatim-staged standard-precision trees
never run the migration pipeline at all, so they are untouched by
construction.

Manifest semantics — entries are exact linker-level names:

* **C sources** (``.c``/``.h``) are rewritten with exact,
  case-sensitive whole-token matches. The manifest carries each
  decoration spelling as its own entry (``blacs_gridinit_`` and
  ``Cblacs_gridinit``; the ``reshape`` / ``reshape_`` / ``RESHAPE``
  alias triple), so a plain token substitution covers every convention
  the sources spell out, including the ``#define name_ NAME`` mangling
  blocks. ``#include`` lines are left alone — file names never change,
  so rewriting a token inside one could only break the include.
* **Fortran sources** are rewritten case-insensitively (and
  case-preservingly) on the underscore-stripped stem of every
  single-trailing-underscore entry: ``CALL DESCINIT`` becomes
  ``CALL EP_DESCINIT`` and gfortran emits ``ep_descinit_``, matching
  the renamed definition. Double-underscore aliases (``…__``, g77
  decoration) and C-only lowercase names never enter the Fortran map.
  The ``RESHAPE`` stem shares its spelling with the Fortran intrinsic,
  but it is renamed like any other entry: the ScaLAPACK band solvers
  ``CALL RESHAPE`` (the REDIST C routine — a ``CALL`` can never be the
  intrinsic, which is a function), and neither the staged trees nor
  upstream ScaLAPACK 2.2.3 contain a genuine intrinsic ``RESHAPE(``
  use (every non-CALL match is a ``SL_GRIDRESHAPE(`` substring, which
  whole-token matching never touches).

Struct *members* are never manifest entries (they are not linker
symbols); if one ever sneaks in, the staged-header ABI assertion in
``staging.py`` (``_assert_shared_struct_abi``) aborts the stage loudly.
