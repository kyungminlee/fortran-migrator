# Migration Recipes

A **recipe** is a YAML file that describes the structure of a numerical library and provides the parameters for its migration. The `migrator` uses these recipes to identify source files, discover symbols, and apply the correct transformations.

## Example: `recipes/blas.yaml`

```yaml
library: blas
language: fortran
source_dir: external/lapack-3.12.1/BLAS/SRC
extensions: [.f]

symbols:
  method: scan_source

prefix:
  style: direct
```

## Recipe Fields

### Core Fields

#### `library` (string, required)
The short name of the library (e.g., `blas`, `lapack`, `scalapack`). Used for generating output filenames and library archives.

#### `language` (string, required)
The primary language of the source files:
*   `fortran`: Uses the hybrid parser-guided / regex migrator.
*   `c`: Uses the "clone-and-substitute" template migrator.

#### `source_dir` (string, required)
The relative path from the project root to the directory containing the source files.

#### `extensions` (list of strings, optional)
File extensions to include. Defaults to `[.f, .f90]`. Use `[.c, .h]` for C libraries. Note: `.F90` (uppercase) triggers preprocessing.

### Symbol Discovery

#### `symbols` (object, optional)
*   `method`:
    *   `scan_source` (default): Scans the `source_dir` for `SUBROUTINE` and `FUNCTION` definitions.
    *   `nm_library`: Uses the `nm` tool to extract symbols from a pre-built library.
*   `library_path`: Path to the pre-built library file (required if `method` is `nm_library`).

### Naming Convention

#### `prefix` (object, optional)
*   `style`:
    *   `direct` (default): Single-character prefix (e.g., `DGEMM` → `QGEMM`).
    *   `scalapack`: `P` + precision character (e.g., `PDGESV` → `PQGESV`).

### File Handling

#### `skip_files` (list of strings, optional)
Source stems to skip during migration (case-insensitive). Useful for mixed-precision routines without a direct target equivalent (e.g., `DSDOT`).

#### `copy_files` (list of strings, optional)
Source stems to copy unchanged. Used for multi-precision utility routines that don't need transformation.

#### `copy_all_originals` (boolean, optional)
*For C migration only.* If `true`, all original source files are copied to the output directory before migrated clones are added. Useful for libraries where only a subset of files are precision-specific.

### Dependencies

#### `depends` (list of strings, optional)
Paths to dependency recipe files (resolved relative to the recipe's directory). Symbols from dependency libraries are included in the rename map. Example:
```yaml
depends:
  - blas.yaml
  - blacs.yaml
```

#### `extra_symbol_dirs` (list of strings, optional)
Extra directories to scan for symbols (resolved relative to project root). Used when symbols needed for renaming are defined outside the main `source_dir`:
```yaml
extra_symbol_dirs:
  - external/lapack-3.12.1/INSTALL
```

### Precision Family Control

#### `prefer_source` (list of strings, optional)
Source stems whose S/C-migrated output should be kept as canonical instead of the default D/Z-first preference. Used when the S/C variant is more correct.

#### `local_renames` (dict, optional)
Maps S/C-half local identifiers to D/Z-half counterparts for convergence normalization:
```yaml
local_renames:
  CR: ZR
  SX: DX
```

### C-Specific Fields

#### `extra_c_dirs` (list of strings, optional)
Additional C source directories to migrate (flat-copied to output_dir). Resolved relative to project root.

#### `c_return_types` (list of strings, optional)
Regex fragments for additional C return types to recognize when scanning for function definitions:
```yaml
c_return_types:
  - 'PBTYP_T\s*\*'
```

#### `c_type_aliases` (list of dicts, optional)
Library-specific C typedef renames. Each entry maps a list of source identifiers to a target using template substitution:
```yaml
c_type_aliases:
  - from: [cmplx, cmplx8]
    to: 'cmplx{RPU}'
  - from: [cmplx16]
    to: 'cmplx{CPU}'
```
Template variables: `{REAL_TYPE}`, `{COMPLEX_TYPE}`, `{C_REAL_TYPE}`, `{RP}`, `{CP}`, `{RPU}`, `{CPU}`.

#### `header_patches` (list of dicts, optional)
Insert content into migrated headers. Each entry specifies an anchor line and text to insert:
```yaml
header_patches:
  - file: TOOLS/PBblacs.h
    after: '#define MPI_DOUBLE_COMPLEX ...'
    insert: '#define MPI_QREAL ...'
    when: kind    # optional: only apply for this target family
```

### Overrides

#### `overrides` (dict, optional)
Target-gated verbatim file overrides. Hand-written files replace migrated output for a specific target:
```yaml
overrides:
  multifloats:
    src_dir: blacs/mfc_overrides
    files:
      - blacs_pinfo_.c
```

#### `patches` (list of strings, optional)
Patch files to apply to the migrated source for complex manual adjustments.

#### `source_overrides` (dict, optional)
Map of upstream filename → replacement source path (resolved relative
to the recipe's directory). When the migrator iterates source files
and encounters a name in this map, it reads from the override path
instead of `source_dir / name`. The override is written in upstream
shape (`DOUBLE PRECISION` types, `pd*`/`pz*` symbol names, `dgemm`
call sites, …) and goes through the normal migration pipeline — so
a single override produces correctly-renamed/promoted output for
every target. Used to carry small bug fixes for upstream sources
without editing `external/`.

```yaml
source_overrides:
  pdlanhs.f: scalapack/source_overrides/pdlanhs.f
  pzlanhs.f: scalapack/source_overrides/pzlanhs.f
```

When using `source_overrides` to fix a bug present only in the D/Z
half (the migrator's default canonical), pin the corresponding
stem(s) in `prefer_source` so the patched body wins convergence
against the unpatched C/S sibling — the canonical-rank picker
doesn't recognize ScaLAPACK's `pd*`/`pz*` two-letter prefix shape
and would otherwise sort `pclanhs.f` ahead of `pzlanhs.f`. See
`doc/UPSTREAM_BUGS.md` for the canonical example.

#### `extra_renames` (dict, optional)
Force-rename entries appended to the classifier's rename map after
family discovery. Used for precision-prefixed orphan symbols whose
S/C sibling does not exist upstream (so the prefix classifier cannot
pair them into a precision family). Each entry maps an upstream
upper-cased identifier to a target template that may reference
`{RP}`/`{CP}`/`{RPU}`/`{CPU}` via target template_vars.

```yaml
extra_renames:
  PDLAIECTB: P{RPU}LAIECTB
  PDLAIECTL: P{RPU}LAIECTL
```

The canonical example is ScaLAPACK's `pdlaiectb_`/`pdlaiectl_`
helpers, which exist only in double precision because the bit-shift
sign-bit hack they rely on is 64-bit-only. Without the rename, the
migrated clones would still export `pdlaiectb_`/`pdlaiectl_`,
clashing with the standard archive's identically-named symbols.
