# eplinalg — MUMPS: orderings, typed solvers, C bridge, genuine dz/sc
#
# include()'d from the staged top-level CMakeLists.txt (same directory
# scope — variables and targets defined here behave exactly as if the
# content were inline). Staged flat next to CMakeLists.txt by
# ``migrator stage`` (see the cmake-glue copy lists in
# ``codegen/migrator/staging.py``).

# 9. MUMPS (depends on LAPACK, BLAS, ScaLAPACK; needs MPI Fortran).
#
# MUMPS is a sparse direct solver (Multifrontal Massively Parallel). The
# migrated archive ``${LIB_PAIR_PREFIX}mumps`` carries the Q/X clones of
# DMUMPS / ZMUMPS plus their auxiliary subroutines.
#
# (The genuine-precision solvers are handled separately at the end of
# this section: libdzmumps / libscmumps rebuild the upstream s/c/d/z
# arithmetics against the in-tree parallel stack.)
#
# MPI is linked PUBLIC because the migrated routines invoke MPI
# primitives (MPI_BCAST / MPI_REDUCE / ...). Downstream callers pass
# ``id%COMM = MPI_COMM_WORLD`` and let MUMPS handle communication
# internally; the link dependency must propagate so executables resolve
# the MPI runtime.

# The baseline staging reuses this file verbatim but builds none of it
# (formerly an ``if(NOT BASELINE_BUILD)`` wrapper around the whole file).

# Layout: each concern below is a named section, invoked in the original
# inline order by the main flow at the bottom of the file. Sections are
# macro()s, NOT function()s, on purpose: a macro runs in the caller's
# scope, so every ``set()`` still lands at directory scope exactly as
# when this file was a single inline block. That is the contract the
# cross-section variables rely on — the MUMPS_HAVE_* gates, the Scotch
# define/flag/rename lists the PT-Scotch section and
# _add_mumps_ordering_defines() consume, and the _mumps_c_* paths the
# genuine build reads; each macro's header lists what it defines and
# consumes. Only the two parameterized helpers stay function()s, and
# they are defined at file scope: a function body recorded inside a
# macro would have its ${ARGN} rewritten by the enclosing macro's own
# argument substitution.

    # hdgraph*/kdgraph*/dorder*/dmapping*/library_dgraph*/library_context_
    # dgraph*, from SCOTCH_LIBPTSCOTCH_SOURCES). Compiled WITH
    # -DSCOTCH_PTSCOTCH (which chains module.h → COMMON_MPI → <mpi.h>) and
    # the SAME -DSCOTCH_NAME_SUFFIX=_mumps rename as sequential Scotch, so
    # the archive is a disjoint increment that references the sequential
    # symbols by their _mumps names and resolves them from libscotch_mumps
    # at link (upstream's -lptscotch -lscotch model). It is genuinely
    # MPI-tied, so it is gated on MPI and installs -${MPI_TAG}-tagged
    # (_MPI_DEPENDENT_LIBS below); the libseq column keeps it off. Turning
    # this on plus -Dptscotch on the MUMPS runtime activates the
    # ICNTL(28)=2 + ICNTL(29)=1 distributed-analysis path, complementing
    # the sequential ICNTL(7)=3 Scotch that libscotch already serves.
    #
    # ptscotch.h / ptscotchf.h are pre-generated & vendored in the include
    # dir (like scotch.h/scotchf.h): dummysizes computes the opaque-struct
    # dims, and those dims are provably MPI-ABI-independent — Dgraph embeds
    # an MPI_Comm by value (8 bytes on OpenMPI, 4 on MPICH/Intel-MPI), but
    # the struct is 8-byte aligned (it holds pointers), so sizeof is always
    # a multiple of 8 and the ≤4-byte delta rounds back up. Verified: the
    # OpenMPI- and Intel-MPI-generated headers are byte-identical.
    # PT-Scotch is a distributed (real-MPI) ordering; the libmpiseq (seq)
    # release links no real MPI, so it is forced off there — matching the
    # "libseq column keeps PT-Scotch off" rule and keeping mumps_common's
