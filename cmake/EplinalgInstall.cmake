# so consumers can do: find_package(qxblas), find_package(qxlapack), etc.
# The common library is bundled into the same export as its precision library.

# Libraries whose *objects* are MPI-ABI-bound (reference MPI symbols or
# bake mpi.h constants) — their installs pass ``MPI`` so the archive
# filename picks up a ``-${MPI_TAG}`` suffix and OpenMPI/MPICH/Intel-MPI
# variants can coexist in the same install prefix. Per an nm audit of
# the installed archives: only blacs and mumps objects reference MPI;
# pblas/pbblas/scalapack reach MPI exclusively through BLACS (their
# archives are byte-identical across MPI flavors), so they carry no
# flavor tag. (ptscotch is also MPI-ABI-tied and carries -${MPI_TAG},
# but it is plain-installed alongside scotch in the mumps block below —
# where the tag is baked into its OUTPUT_NAME at target creation — not
# through this list.)

# for the Netlib archives — each shared target is exported ONCE, in its
# own package, and the precision Configs ``find_dependency`` it. The
# content-driven archive filenames make the three trees emit
# byte-identical ``.a`` files, so the shared package is a genuine
# last-writer-wins no-op on re-install.

    # dependency of every m/w Fortran archive: those archives leave the
    # module procedures as *undefined* references (we link it BUILD_INTERFACE
    # so they compile against its .mod, but the symbols are NOT baked in the
    # way the header-only C++ core is). A find_package consumer therefore has
    # to link libmultifloatsf itself, so it must be installed as its own
    # package. The FetchContent'd multifloats sub-build gates its own install
    # off (MULTIFLOATSF_INSTALL_PRECOMPILED_MOD, and it is EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL),
    # so we install the target from here. Non-MPI, clean interface (PRIVATE
    # includes only), so no DEPENDS / MPI tag. Built on demand as a link
    # dependency of the m/w targets (which ARE in ALL), so the archive exists
    # by install time despite EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL.
    # The C++ double-double *core* ``multifloats`` (extern "C" adddd / cadddd /
    # sindd / csqrtdd … from multifloats_math.cc) is a genuine link dependency:
    # the Fortran module procedures in libmultifloatsf call straight into these
    # C-ABI functions, and they are NOT baked into any m/w archive (only
    # header-instantiated template ops are). The FetchContent'd sub-build already
    # installs it as package ``multifloats`` under namespace ``multifloats::``
    # (add_subdirectory EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL excludes it from the default *build*
    # target, but the sub-build's install() rules still run), so we do NOT
    # re-install it here — doing so would place ``multifloats`` in a second
    # export set and break install(EXPORT multifloatsfTargets), which requires
    # its dependency to live in exactly one. We only wire multifloatsf's Config
    # to find it (below).

    # multifloatsfConfig below) finds nothing. Install ONLY the portable
    # non-LTO core and a nolto-only Config (omit the lto-* target files) so
    # every consumer resolves multifloats::multifloats to the COMDAT-foldable
