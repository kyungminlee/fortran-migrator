# Differential precision tests for migrated PBLAS

This directory extends the `tests/blas/` scaffold to the **distributed**
extended-precision PBLAS libraries (`${LIB_PREFIX}pblas` —
`qpblas`, `epblas`, `ddpblas`). Each test runs a PBLAS operation over
a BLACS process grid, gathers the distributed result back to rank 0,
and compares against serial quad-precision BLAS applied to the full
global matrix.

The structure mirrors `tests/blas/` closely — the core testing model
(reference vs. target, tolerance formula, JSON report, per-target
wrapper contract) is unchanged. Everything below describes only the
things that are *different* because the routines under test are
distributed.


## Testing model

Each test runs in the following order (on every MPI rank):

1. `grid_init()` — BLACS + MPI initialization, picks a 2D grid shape
   as close to square as possible for the given process count
   (2×2 for NP=4, 1×1 for NP=1, 1×N for prime NP).
2. For each problem shape:
   - Every rank independently materializes the **full global**
     vector/matrix at REAL(KIND=16) using a deterministic seed — so
     ranks don't need to scatter, they each read their own
     block-cyclic piece from their own mirrored copy.
   - The per-target wrapper (`target_pdgemm` etc.) converts the local
     arrays to the target's precision, calls the migrated PBLAS
     routine (`pqgemm` / `pegemm` / `pddgemm`), and converts the
     in/out buffers back to quad.
   - Rank 0 gathers the distributed result from every process via
     point-to-point `MPI_BYTE` transfers (MPI_REAL16 is not portable).
   - Rank 0 computes the reference by running the serial
     **quad-precision Netlib BLAS** (`refblas_quad`, built by
     `tests/blas/refblas/`) on the full global matrix.
   - Rank 0 computes `max_rel_err` and calls `report_case`; non-zero
     ranks skip it.
3. `report_finalize()` is collective — rank 0 broadcasts the pass/fail
   flag so every rank exits with the same code and ctest observes a
   uniform failure/success across the entire `mpirun` invocation.
4. `grid_exit()` tears down BLACS + MPI.

Tolerance still follows `safety_factor * n_ops * target_eps`, but the
safety factor is doubled over the BLAS suite (16 → 32 for most cases,
64 for triangular solves) to absorb the small amount of extra rounding
that comes from SUMMA-style summation orders in PBLAS kernels.


### Reference strategy

PBLAS is a C library, so the `-freal-8-real-16` promotion that builds
`refblas_quad` from Netlib Fortran sources does not apply. Rather than
porting 122 C files to `__float128` plus MPI types, this test suite
uses the **serial** quad-precision BLAS as a differential reference:
the migrated distributed routine at target precision should agree with
serial BLAS at quad precision up to rounding and SUMMA summation order.

Consequence: `tests/blas/` must also be staged for PBLAS tests to
build — the CMakeLists gates on `TARGET refblas_quad` and skips
gracefully otherwise.

## Per-target wrapper contract

Every `target_<target>/target_pblas.f90` exposes the same module
`target_pblas` with:

```fortran
module target_pblas
    public :: target_name, target_eps
    public :: target_pddot, target_pdgemm, …  ! one per routine
end module
```

- `target_name`: used in JSON filename (`<routine>.<target_name>.json`).
- `target_eps`: target's machine epsilon for tolerance sizing.
- Each wrapper takes REAL(KIND=16) / COMPLEX(KIND=16) local
  distributed arrays + unchanged descriptor/index arguments, casts
  element-wise to the target native type, calls the migrated PBLAS
  routine, and casts the in/out buffer back to quad. Descriptors are
  distribution info — they pass through unchanged regardless of target
  precision.

The migrated name scheme (scalapack-style single-character slot
substitution):

| original | kind10   | kind16   | multifloats |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `pdgemm` | `pegemm` | `pqgemm` | `pddgemm`   |
| `pddot`  | `pedot`  | `pqdot`  | `pdddot`    |
| `pzgemm` | `pygemm` | `pxgemm` | `pzzgemm`   |
| `pzherk` | `pyherk` | `pxherk` | `pzzherk`   |


## Running

```bash
python -m pyengine stage /tmp/staging-kind16 --target kind16 \
       --libraries blas blacs ptzblas pbblas pblas
cmake -S /tmp/staging-kind16 -B /tmp/staging-kind16/build \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /tmp/staging-kind16/build -j8
ctest --test-dir /tmp/staging-kind16/build -R '^pblas_' --output-on-failure
python scripts/precision_report.py /tmp/staging-kind16/build/precision_reports/
```

The process count is fixed at configure time via `-DPBLAS_TEST_NPROC=<N>`
(default 4 → 2×2 grid). `-DPBLAS_TEST_NPROC=1` runs every test in a
degenerate 1×1 grid, useful as a sanity check.

Staging **must** include `blas`, `blacs`, `ptzblas`, `pbblas`, and
`pblas`. `cmake/CMakeLists.txt` wires `${LIB_PREFIX}pblas` to depend
only on `blas` + `blacs`, but the migrated pblas C code calls into
PTZBLAS (e.g. `qvasum_`) and PBBLAS kernels at runtime — the tests
link those two libraries explicitly to satisfy the references. Without
the `blas` library staged, `refblas_quad` isn't built and the PBLAS
tests skip.


## Reading the report

The JSON output uses the same filename convention as the BLAS suite
(`<routine>.<target>.json` in `<build>/precision_reports/`) and
`scripts/precision_report.py` scans that directory without any
PBLAS-specific changes — PBLAS rows appear in the same summary table
as BLAS rows.

| routine | kind10 | kind16 | multifloats |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| ddot    | 17.59  | exact  | 30.68       |
| pddot   | ~17.2  | exact  | ~29.8       |
| pdgemm  | ~17.0  | exact  | ~29.5       |

For kind16 PBLAS rows, "exact" is the expected outcome when the
tolerance comfortably absorbs SUMMA summation-order differences —
reference and target are both at REAL(KIND=16), and the migrated
distributed algorithm differs from serial BLAS only in associativity.


## Adding a new test

For a PBLAS routine `pxroutine` already wrapped in every
`target_<target>/target_pblas.f90` and declared in
`common/ref_quad_blas.f90`:

1. Drop a new program into the appropriate `level{1,2,3}/` directory
   (one of the existing `test_pd*.f90` files makes a suitable
   starting template).
2. `CMakeLists.txt` picks up `test_*.f90` via
   `file(GLOB CONFIGURE_DEPENDS …)`, so no manual registration is
   needed.

For a routine **not** yet declared:
1. Add an explicit interface to `common/ref_quad_blas.f90` for the
   corresponding serial reference routine.
2. Add wrappers to *every* `target_<target>/target_pblas.f90` —
   signature is uniformly REAL(KIND=16) / COMPLEX(KIND=16) on the
   outside.


## Open issues

### Multifloats PBLAS C linkage

The multifloats target compiles migrated C sources as C++ (to pick up
`float64x2_t` operator overloading). PBLAS's Fortran-callable entry
points (`pddgemm_`, `pzzherk_`, …) are defined without explicit
`extern "C"`, so under C++ compilation every entry point is
name-mangled and `target_pblas.f90` can't resolve them at link time.
Running `ctest` on a multifloats staging build will therefore skip
`tests/pblas` (`CMakeLists.txt` returns early when `C_AS_CXX` is on).

Fixing this requires lockstep `extern "C"` wrappers on both the
function declarations (in `PBpblas.h` / `PBtools.h`) and the per-file
entry-point definitions generated by the C migrator. Until that lands,
the kind10 and kind16 targets exercise the migrated PBLAS code paths
in full.
