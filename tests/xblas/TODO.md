All **43 family heads** of XBLAS are tested and passing on the kind
targets — full user-facing surface coverage.  See `level1/`, `level2/`, `level3/` for the test
drivers.

The complex-symmetric variants (`zsymv_x`, `zsbmv_x`, `zspmv_x`) and
the head/tail (`*2`) variants and `ge_sum_mv_x` have no standard-BLAS
analogue; their references are hand-coded at REAL(KIND=16) precision
in `common/ref_quad_xblas.f90`.

## Open follow-ups

### Other targets

The current pass is **kind16-only**.  The wrapper module is fypp-
parameterised on the prefix character pair, so `kind10` (`e`/`y`)
and `multifloats` (`m`/`w`) targets should build out of the box —
but they haven't been smoke-tested yet.  Multifloats in particular
will exercise the `_Complex __float128` → `cmplx64x2` substitution
path, which has subtleties around C++/`extern "C"` wrapping that
the existing BLACS multifloats build navigates.  Likely follow-up:
stage at multifloats, fix any header_patch issues, add target-mode-
specific tolerances if the dd-on-quad accumulator drift requires it.

### Mixed-input variants

The 402 mixed-input-precision variants (`BLAS_dgemv_d_s_x`,
`BLAS_zaxpby_c`, ...) are skipped by the recipe — they're not
expressible in a single extended-precision target.  If a future
caller needs one of these, the path is to add a hand-written
override in `recipes/xblas/mfc_overrides/` rather than trying to
push them through the family classifier.

### LAPACK xx-family unblocking (P17xx)

`tests/lapack/TODO.md` §P17xx documents 18 LAPACK extra-precise
iterative-refinement drivers (`gesvxx`, `gbsvxx`, ...) blocked on
XBLAS being available.  XBLAS is now available; unblocking those
tests is its own task — it requires editing
`recipes/lapack.yaml` (un-skip the `*la_*_extended.f` files),
adding a `BUILD_XBLAS=ON`-style gate so callers that don't link
xblas don't get poisoned, and writing the test wrappers.  Strictly
out-of-scope for `tests/xblas/`; tracked in the lapack tree.

## Cross-tests/ items deferred

None.  `tests/CMakeLists.txt` already iterates `STAGED_LIBRARIES`,
so `tests/xblas/CMakeLists.txt` is picked up automatically once
`xblas` appears in `LIBRARY_ORDER` (which it now does).

## Known XBLAS oddities to remember

- All uniform-precision XBLAS entry points carry the `_x` suffix and
  the `prec` enum parameter — there is no `BLAS_dgemv` (without
  `_x`) in the source distribution.  Tests pass `blas_prec_extra=214`
  via the wrapper.
- The `dot_x` family computes `r := α·(x.y) + β·r` (with `r` as
  inout), not the bare `(x.y)` of standard `ddot`.
- The XBLAS conj enum is `blas_no_conj=192`, `blas_conj=191` —
  *not* the trans-style 111/112 numbers — get this wrong and only
  the conj=1 case fails (conj=0 is identical to no-op conjugation).
- The XBLAS triangular routines (`trmv_x`, `tpmv_x`, `tbsv_x`,
  `trsv_x`) take an `α` argument that standard BLAS triangular
  routines do not.  Reference implementations call standard
  `*trmv`/`*trsv` then scale by α (or scale before, for solves).
- Complex parameters in the C API are `void *`; from Fortran via
  ISO_C_BINDING we declare them as `complex(ep)` (passed by
  reference).  Memory layout matches because `complex(KIND=16)` is
  two adjacent `__float128` values.
- The XBLAS `f2c-bridge` macros default to no-mangling; the migrator
  build sets `-DCONFIG_FC_UNDERSCORE` so the Fortran-callable names
  end with `_` (matching gfortran's emit convention).  If we ever
  add an Intel / Cray Fortran build we'll need a different gate
  (`-DCONFIG_FC_UCASE` or `-DCONFIG_FC_DBL_UNDERSCORE`).
