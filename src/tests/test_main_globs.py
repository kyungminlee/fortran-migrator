"""Tests for ``_collect_source_files`` — the source-file discovery helper used
by ``cmd_stage`` to enumerate migrated outputs into the CMake manifest.

The helper must include capital-F preprocessed Fortran (``.F``) so that
LAPACK 2-stage routines (``iparam2stage.F``, ``dsytrd_sb2st.F``,
``zhetrd_hb2st.F``) reach the manifest. ``Path.glob`` is case-sensitive on
Linux, so ``*.f`` does **not** match ``*.F``; the helper must glob both.
